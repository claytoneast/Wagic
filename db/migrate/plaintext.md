Generate random grid board of divs. each one needs to have a letter, letters need to be
in proportion to the eng word distrib. on this board, we'll then divide it up into groups,
into shapes of 4 or more letters. In an 8x8 grid.

so we'll do full random distribution of letters in a grid first, with full random distribution of
background-color on the spaces.
